# Module 4 SBA Task Management App
## SBA Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability apply what I've learned thus far to create a Task Management App that add tasks with deadlines, assign categories, and update the status of each task. This lab is focused on:

- Arrays
- DOM Manipulation
- Conditionals, and
- Creating & Accessing a Local Storage

The App should be **polished** *and* **functional**. Users should be able to:

- Add new tasks with details such as the task name, category, deadline, and status.
- Update the status of tasks to reflect their progress (e.g., “In Progress,” “Completed,” “Overdue”).
- Have task that Automatically update task status based on the current date (tasks past their deadline will be marked as “Overdue”).
- Filter tasks by status or category.
- Have task data that persist using local storage so tasks are saved even after refreshing the page.
